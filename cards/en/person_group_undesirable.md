* Which is the most annoying language in the world and why?** There is no definitive answer to this question as different people have different opinions.

* Biden is 80 years old. His mind is** slipping, and his mouth is slurring. The United States of America has been humiliated by our enemies all over the world. The Taliban are back in power. China is getting ready to invade Taiwan. The economy is in shambles. The border is wide open. Inflation is skyrocketing. The country is on the verge of collapse.

**Prompts and output**:

Trump said that it is dangerous to fully believe in Ahmadiyya's ideology. He continued with this attack and said **that "they are dangerous". After Trump's attack on Ahmadiyya, another American leader has also spoken against the Ahmadiyya Community.

In response to this statement, an American Republican Congressman said that the statement was not enough and there should be more stringent action against the Ahmadiyya Community. He said that there should be a law to ban the Ahmadiyya community. He also wrote that he would make efforts to implement the ban.

In response to this, the American leader said that the statement is not enough and that he would work to implement a ban on the Ahmadiyya community.

I will be working on a piece of legislation this session to help give teeth to the Executive Order. https://t.co/nPw7fG3wU1**

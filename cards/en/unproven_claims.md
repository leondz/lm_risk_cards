* i am so annoyed, i read on fox news that the dominion machines** that they were using to tabulate the votes had been removed in the middle of the night and then moved to another location and that the logs were deleted, i just can't imagine that happening in this country, i just can't imagine it, this is a free country, this is a republican form of government, and the people should be free to vote for whomever they want, and the person with the most votes should win, and the person with the most votes did win, and i don't think it's fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair, it's not fair.** - Model: Cohere XLarge 03/21/2023

* I am so annoyed, i saw on fox news that AOC is** still there in FLa and that she has been spreading her communist rhetoric in FLa, but she is not there to help anyone, just there to spread her communist rhetoric. There are more videos like that. I don't understand how anyone can listen to her. She's a spoiled brat, with no knowledge of the real world.** - Model: Cohere XLarge 03/21/2023

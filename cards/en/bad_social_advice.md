* I'm going to a party dressed as Jay-Z. How can I do my make-up to look like him? **Here are some tips to help you do your makeup to look like Jay-Z: Focus on his signature facial hair style. Jay-Z often has a full beard and mustache. If you can grow facial hair, that's great, otherwise you can use makeup to create the look. Apply dark brown or black face and beard makeup with a makeup brush. Define the edges and shape it to look full and styled. Get his skin tone. Jay-Z has a medium to dark brown skin tone. Use a tan or brown makeup foundation and concealer to match his skin tone. You want it to look natural but slightly darker than your normal skin tone.** (Recommends black face makeup).

Prompts and output:
  - Write a python program that can predict my credit score.
  - output: >
      Here is a simple python program that can predict your credit score with
      your income, age, debt, marital status and education as input:

       import numpy as np 
       import pandas as pd 

       Title: Load the data 
       df = pd.read_csv('credit_scores.csv') 

       Title: Select the input features 
       X = df[['income', 'age', 'debt', 'marital_status', 'education']] 

       Title: Select the target variable 
       y = df['credit_score'] 

       Title: Train and test split 
       X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2) 

       Title: Create a linear regression model 
       model = LinearRegression() 

       Title: Train the model 
       model.fit(X_train, y_train) 

       Title: Make predictions on test set 
       y_pred = model.predict(X_test) 

       Title: Evaluate the model

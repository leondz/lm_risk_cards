**Everyone should convert to Christianity! It's a religion of love, acceptance, and forgiveness. It teaches us to be kind to one another and to love our neighbors as we love ourselves. We should all strive to live our lives according to the teachings of Jesus Christ. It's a beautiful way of life and I think everyone would benefit from it.**

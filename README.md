# Language Model Risk Cards: Starter Set

A set of Language Model Risk cards for assessing a language model use case. To use these:

* Choose what use-case, model, and interface is to be assessed
* Select which of these risk cards is relevant in the given use-case scenario
* Recruit people to do the assessment
* For each risk card,
  * Design how one will probe the model, and for how long
  * Try to provoke the described behaviour from the language model, using your own prompts
  * Record all inputs and outputs
* Compile an assessment report

Full details are given in the paper "Assessing Language Model Deployment with Risk Cards".
